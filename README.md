## Alternative Assessment
Alternative assessment refers to a variety of methods and techniques used to evaluate student learning and achievement beyond traditional standardized tests and exams. It offers a more holistic and comprehensive approach to assessing students' knowledge, skills, and understanding of a subject.

Alternative assessment recognizes that students have diverse learning styles, abilities, and strengths, and aims to provide a more accurate representation of their abilities. It focuses on assessing real-world application of knowledge, critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration skills.

Here are some common examples of alternative assessment methods:

1. Performance-Based Assessments: These assessments require students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills by completing real-life tasks or projects. For example, students might be asked to create a scientific experiment, write an essay, design a website, or deliver a presentation.

2. Project-Based Learning: This approach involves students engaging in an extended project or investigation, where they apply their knowledge and skills to solve complex problems or create a product. The final project is often assessed based on criteria such as creativity, research skills, critical thinking, and presentation.

Alternative assessment offer several advantages over traditional assessments. They provide a more authentic representation of students' abilities, encourage higher-order thinking skills, promote creativity and innovation, and enhance student engagement and motivation. Additionally, alternative assessments allow for personalized and differentiated evaluation, catering to individual learning styles and preferences.

## Dataset
Each student will be allocated a specific dataset exclusively for the purpose of conducting the Alternative Assessment. It is strictly prohibited to employ any other datasets. All responses and solutions provided for the Alternative Assessment must be derived solely from the assigned dataset.
