# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Muhammad Dinie Hazim Bin Azali
#### Matric No.: A20EC0084
#### Dataset: [Stories](https://github.com/drshahizan/dataset/tree/main/mongodb/07-stories)

## Question 5 (a)
In order to optimize the perfomance of a portal when dealing with large volumes of JSON data for dashboard visualizations, we can consider certain ways.

#### Convert date type

1. Open MongoDB Compass.
   <img src="./files/images/mongodbCompass.png">
2. Open your Mongo Shell.
3. In my dataset, my `submit_date` and `promote_date` was in Unix timestamp.
4. In order to change it to format that I want, I run this code below in Mongo Shell.
   ```
      db.Stories.updateMany(
        {},
        [
          {
            $set: {
              submit_date: {
                $toDate: {
                  $multiply: ["$submit_date", 1000]
                }
              },
              promote_date: {
                $toDate: {
                  $multiply: ["$promote_date", 1000]
                }
              }
            }
          },
          {
            $set: {
              submit_year: { $year: "$submit_date" },
              promote_year: { $year: "$promote_date" }
            }
          }
        ]
      );
   ```

5. This is the value of `submit_date` and `promote_date` that I get after run the code.
   <img src="./files/images/afteraggregate.png">
6. The first $set stage converts the submit_date and promote_date fields to date format.
7. The second $set stage extracts the years from the converted dates and assigns them to submit_year and promote_year fields

#### Indexing

1. I create indexes on fields that are frequently used for queries such as `submit_date`, `promote_date`, `comments` and `diggs`.
   <img src="./files/images/date_indexing.png">

   <img src="./files/images/promote_indexing.png">

   <img src="./files/images/comments.png">

   <img src="./files/images/diggs.png">

#### Aggregation:

1. I create aggregation to summarize the total diggs and comments based on topic.
2. Click on the Add Stage button.
   ![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/assets/120595244/f25bff33-b8c3-4d68-b422-c5d144640440)
3. For the stage type, choose $group and insert the code below
   ```
      {
         {
           _id: "$topic.name",
           totalComments: { $sum: "$comments" },
           totalDiggs: { $sum: "$diggs" }
         }
      }
   ```

4. Here is my sample output.

5. Click Run to run the pipeline.
6. Final result.

## Question 5 (b)

#### Import JSON dataset into MongoDB

For this step, can refer my [Question 2(a)](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/10fa31e68212c6819884e25714778b51d031b2e1/submission/DinieHazim/question%202/question2.md) for better insight.

#### Create Dashboard

1. Login to your MongoDB Atlas account by simply go this [link](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?signedOut=true)
2. In the navigation bar, click on the button named `Charts`.
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./files/images/charts.png">
   </p>
3. It will bring you to the Welcome page and simply click on the Start button.
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./files/images/start.png">
   </p>
4. Select the Chart Builder to create a chart with your own data.
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./files/images/chart_builder.png">
   </p>
5. Select your collection.
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./files/images/select.png">
   </p>
7. It will bring you to this page so that you can start to drag and drop attributes fields to make a chart.

   </p>

#### Charts and Dashboard development

<p align="center">
   <img src="./files/images/Number%20of%20Comments%20for%20each%20Topic.png">
</p>
For this chart, I want to know which topic have the highest number of comments by dragging `comments` to the X-axis and `topic_name` to the Y-axis.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./files/images/Number%20of%20Stories%20in%20each%20Date%26nbsp%3B.png">
</p>
In this chart, I want to know the number stories submitted in each date. I put the `submit_date` in the X-axis and count the `title` in Y-axis.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./files/images/Number%20of%20Stories%20in%20each%20Media.png">
</p>
This pie chart will show me the number of stories in each media. This is because I want to know which media has the most uploaded stories in it.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./files/images/Relationship%20between%20number%20of%20Comments%20and%20Diggs.png">
</p>
This scatter plot will show the relationship between `diggs` and `comments`. From this chart, we can conclude that highest diggs will probably have the highest comments.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./files/images/Total%20Comments%20%26amp%3B%20Diggs%20for%20each%20Month.png">
</p>
This chart shows the total comments and diggs in each month so that I can know which month has the highest visit by the user.

<p align="center">
   <img src="./files/images/Total%20Number%20of%20Diggs%20based%20on%20Topic%20of%20Story.png">
</p>
For the last chart, I want to know the number of diggs based on each topic so that I can know which topic has the highest popularity.

Here is my dashboard:
