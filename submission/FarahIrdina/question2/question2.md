# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: FARAH IRDINA BINTI AHMAD BAHARUDIN
#### Matric No.: A20EC0035
#### Dataset: AIRBNB LISTINGS DATASET

## Question 2 (a)

### Steps to import JSON file into MongoDB

The JSON file that I have been received is about AirBnb Listing Reviews. To import this JSON file inside MongoDB database, there are a few steps that must be followed.

#### 1. Install MongoDB Command Line Database Tools

Firstly, click [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/bi-connector) to download MongoDB Command Line Database Tools. Click Download and install it.

#### 2. Install MongoDB Shell

Next, click [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/bi-connector) to download MongoDB Shell. Click Download and install it.

#### 3. Run mongosh

Then, open the directory file that has the mongosh.exe by using command prompt and type the code below. 

```
mongosh
```

#### 4. Search for existing databases

Next, to search the existing databases inside your MongoDB, type the code below. 

```
show dbs
```

![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/FarahIrdina/question2/files/images/dbs.png)

#### 5. Use any database

Next, use any database that you prefer based on the list of databases above. I will use 'admin' database to store the JSON data. Type the code below. 

```
use admin
```

![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/FarahIrdina/question2/files/images/admin.png)

#### 6. Search for existing collections

Then, to search the existing collections inside your database, type the code below. 

```
show collections
```

#### 7. Import JSON file into MongoDB

Lastly, you can import your JSON file into MongoDB. Type the code below. 

```
mongoimport --db admin --collection airbnb --file C:\Users\User\Downloads\listingsAndReviews.json
```

### Output

Finally, the JSON file will be stored in MongoDB.

## Question 2 (b)

There are five queries that will be performed which are Create, Read, two queries of Update, and Delete (CRUD) on the documents stored in the MongoDB database. All the queries have different types of functions.

#### 1. Connect to MongoDB

Before performing any operations, you need to connect to the MongoDB database. Open the directory file of mongosh.exe and insert the MongoDB's connection string. 

```
mongodb://localhost:27017
```

#### 2. Use any database

Next, use the database that you have stored the data. I will use 'admin' database since it is the database that I used to store the airbnb data. Type the code below. 

```
use admin
```

#### 3. Perform operations

##### - Create

Create allows user to insert data into the database. Type the code below to insert one.

```
