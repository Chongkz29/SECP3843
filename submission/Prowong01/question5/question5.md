# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Eddie Wong Chung Pheng
#### Matric No.: A20EC0031
#### Dataset: <a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/dataset/tree/main/mongodb/04-companies" >Companies</a>

## Question 5 (a)
Data Preprocessing is a crucial step in optimizing the performance of a portal or any data-driven system. It involves transforming and cleaning the raw data to make it suitable for analysis, storage, and retrieval. The goal of preprocessing is to enhance data quality, reduce noise, and improve efficiency in subsequent tasks such as data mining, machine learning, or user interactions. 

In this case, I use companies.json as my dataset.

### Step 1: Install the required libraries
```
!pip install pymongo
```

### Step 2: Import the required libraries
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pymongo
```

### Step 3: Connect to MongoDB and Load Data 
Make sure the collection does exist in the Cluster server so that the pymongo can load the data.

```
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb+srv://prowong42:eddie2001@cluster0.hdgexg2.mongodb.net/")
db = client["test"]
collection = db["companies"]
data = list(collection.find())

#Convert to Dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df.head(10)
```

### Step 4: Data Cleaning
Checking Null Data
```
 df.isna().sum()
```

<img  src="./files/images/before_clean.png"></img>

Clean the data
```
 df["category_code"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["number_of_employees"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["founded_day"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["founded_year"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["founded_month"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["deadpooled_year"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["tag_list"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["alias_list"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["founded_month"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["deadpooled_month"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["deadpooled_day"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
 df["deadpooled_url"].fillna("NaN", inplace = True)
```

### Step 4: Data Reduction
Drop some unwanted column & rows that contain NaN data 
```
 columns_to_drop = ['email_address', 'phone_number','description','overview','image','ipo','twitter_username','acquisition','homepage_url','blog_url','blog_feed_url']
 df = df.drop(columns_to_drop, axis=1)
 df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

Check again
```
df.isna().sum()
```

## Another way is Indexing
### Step 1: Define which columns has to be indexed in the model
For my case, I will choose ``` founded_year ``` so that the database engine can quickly locate the required data based on the indexed fields.

### Step 2: Update the database 
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Question 5 (b)
### Step 1: Login to MongoDB Atlas and Load the dataset
Go to this <a href="https://charts.mongodb.com/"> link </a> to start create dashboard and select the dataset.

### Step 2: Go to MongoDB Chart develop dashboard
Create a dashboard in MongoDB Charts and add charts using your JSON data. You can use different chart types to visualize your data, such as bar charts, line charts, maps, etc. You can also apply filters and aggregations to your data

### Dashboard

### Bar Chart
This bar chart shows the employee size and funding raised amount for various companies and startups in the dataset. This allows to see the relationship and comparison of employee size and funding raised amount for different companies and startups.

### Line Chart
This line chart shows the stock symbol and IPO valuation amount over the year for various companies and startups in the dataset. This chart allows to see the trends and patterns of stock symbol and IPO valuation amount over the year for different companies and startups.

### Donut Chart
This donut chart shows the top 10 most popular category codes by company count in the dataset. A donut chart is a circular chart that shows the proportion of each category within the total. The larger the slice, the higher the company count. This chart allows to see the popularity and ranking of different category codes by company count.

### Heatmap
This heatmap shows the frequency of founded year and deadpooled year for various companies and startups in the dataset. A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the values are encoded by colors. The darker the color, the higher the frequency. This heatmap allows to see the distribution and concentration of founded year and deadpooled year for different companies and startups.

### Line Chart
This chart shows the category and acquisition price amount for companies and startups over the year. The columns show the total price for each category and the lines show the percentage of each category. This report helps to see the changes and differences of category and price over the year.
