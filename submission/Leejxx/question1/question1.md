- ###  User
  - The User component represents the end-user or client who interacts with the web application.
  - Users access the application through a web browser and initiate requests by interacting with the user interface.

- ### Web Server
  - The Web Server component receives HTTP requests from users and forwards them to the appropriate URL within the Django application.
  - It handles the communication between the user's web browser and the application.
 
- ### Django Web Application
   In this project, Django will be as the framework for the web application.Django is a high-level web framework written in Python that follows 
   <b>MVT</b> architectural pattern, although it refers to the components as Models, Views, and Templates. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building web applications efficiently and securely.
  - Model :
    - The Model component in Django defines the data structure and provides an interface to interact with the database.
    - It represents the logical structure of the data and includes fields and relationships between different entities.
    - In this case, the Model interacts with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data represented in JSON format and also intracts with MySQL to manage the user registration and login.
  - Views :
    - The Views component contains the business logic of the application.
    - It processes the HTTP requests received from the Web Server, interacts with the Models and Databases, and prepares the appropriate response.
    - Views can perform actions such as retrieving data from the Models, modifying data, and rendering templates for the user interface.
  - Template
    - The Template component is responsible for rendering the user interface and generating dynamic web pages.
    - It defines the HTML structure and includes placeholders for dynamic content to be populated by Views.
    - Templates are rendered by Views and combined with data to produce the final output that is sent back to the user's browser.

- ### Database
  - MongoDB:
    - MongoDB is a NoSQL document database.
    - In this architecture, MongoDB is used as the database for storing data represented in JSON format.
    - The Model component interacts with the MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - MySQL:
    - MySQL is a relational database management system.
    - The MySQL database is used specifically for user authentication in this architecture.
    - It stores user-related information, such as usernames, passwords, and other authentication details.
    - The user authentication functionality is handled separately from the main data storage in MongoDB.
- ### JSON Dataset (Supply Store Dataset)
   - The JSON dataset contains information about sales transactions, including items purchased, customer details, store location, coupon usage, and purchase method.
   - The dataset serves as the source of data for the portal's visualization and analysis features.
 
- ### Libraries user
   - Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
       - Django's ORM is primarily designed to work with relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
       - In this case, we use Django's ORM to interact with the MySQL database for user authentication.
       - Django's ORM provides an object-oriented interface to define models, query the database, and perform CRUD operations.
   - Djongo:
       - Djongo is a package that allows Django to integrate with MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
       - In this case, we use Djongo to interact with MongoDB for storing and retrieving JSON data.
       - Djongo translates Django's ORM queries and operations into MongoDB-specific queries, allowing us to utilize Django's ORM syntax and features with MongoDB.
