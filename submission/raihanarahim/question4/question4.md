# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Amirah Raihanah binti Abdul Rahim
#### Matric No.: A20EC0182
#### Dataset: Tweets

## Question 4 (a)
### Machine Learning approach on Tweets Dataset.
The machine learning method I chose is classification which is a supervised machine learning and I used K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.

<br>

For my case study, I  focused on developing a classification model to determine whether tweets will become trending or not. To obtain the result, I use the feature selection technique to obtain the best features that can contirubute in classifying the tweets. Then, I define what it means by trending or not by using the engagement ratio between `favourites_count` / `followers_count`. 

<br>

The process involved are :
* `Data Cleaning` : 
* `Data Wrangling` :
* `Defining label for trending` :
* `Feature Selection` :
* `Apply ML algorithm` :
* `Analyze results` :
