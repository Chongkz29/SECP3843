# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: AHMAD AIMAN HAFIZI BIN MUHAMMAD
#### Matric No.: A20EC0177
#### Dataset: ANALYTICS DATASET

## Question 5 (a)
When working with large JSON data, several steps can be taken to help optimize the performance of the portal

>*Data Preprocessing*:
Performing data preprocessing steps to reduce the data size and improve data quality. This action may include filtering inconsistent data, remove noisy data, and eliminating duplicates.

>*Data Indexing*:
Using appropriate indexing techniques on the large dataset to optimize up data retrieval and querying. Indexing helps to quickly locating and accessing specific records, reducing the processing time for filtering and searching operations.

## Question 5 (b)
Use MongoDB Atlass to visualize the JSON files

1. Open MongoDB Atlass.

2. Click `Charts` tabs add a new Dashboard called `Customer Analysis`

3. After that, click `Add Chart` to begin building some visualizations

4. A new tab will open. Select the cluster that will be use for visualization. In this case, the `projectCluster`. Select the database name `Analytics`. Select `Customers` collections.
