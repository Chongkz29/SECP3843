# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Muhammad Naquib Bin Zakaria
#### Matric No.: A20BE0161
#### Dataset: 03 - Movie

## Question 1 (a)

Here are comprehensive explanation of the steps required to integrate Django with the JSON dataset, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval from both MySQL and MongoDB databases:

Step 1. Define Django Models
- Identify the structure the JSON dataset and create Django models that represent the data.
- Define fields in the models that correspond to the attributes of the JSON dataset.
- Consider using appropriate field types such as CharField, TextField, DateTime, etc., based on the data in the JSON dataset.

Step 2. Set up Database Connections
- Configure database connections in Django's settings.py file to connect to both MySQL and MongoDB.
- Specify the connection details such as host, port, username, password, and database name for each database.

Step 3. Create Django Database
- Run Django's migration command "python manage.py migrate" to create the necessary database tables for the Django models.
- This step creates the tables in both MySQL and MongoDB databases, ensuring the required schema for data storage.

Step 4. Load JSON Data into Django Models
- Write Python code or management commands in Django to load the JSON dataset into the Django models.
- Parse the JSON data and use Django's model APIs to create instances of the models and populate them with the data.
- Save the model instances to the respective databases, both MySQL and MongoDB.

Step 5. Retrieve Data from Databases
- In Django views or API endpoints, write code to retrieve data from both MySQL adn MongoDB databases.
- Use Django's query APIs to perform efficient and optimized queries on the database tables ot retrieve the required data.
- Leverage the Django ORM's features, such as filtering, ordering, and aggregations, to handle complex data retrieval operations.

Step 6. Efficient Data Storage
- Utilize the database-specific features and optimizations provided by MySQL and MongoDB for efficient data storage.
- In MySQL, take advantage of indexes, query optimizations, and data normalization techniques to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of structured data.
- In MongoDB, leverage the flexibility and scalability of the document-oriented database model to store and retrieve JSON data efficiently.

Step 7. Maintain Data Consistency
- Implement appropriate data validation and integrity checks in your Django models and database schemas to maintain data consistency.
- Ensure that the data stored in both MySQL and MongoDB databases aligns with the defined structure and constraints of your Django models.

Step 8. Monitor and Optimize Performance
- Regularly monitor the performance of your Django application and the interactions with the databases.
- Identify bottlenecks, optimize database queries, and fine-tune the database configurations to improve performance.
- Consider implementing caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the databases and enhance response times.

Step 9. Test and Refine
- Thoroughly test your application's integration with the JSON dataset, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- Verify data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations to ensure they meet your requirements.
- Gather user feedback, monitor system behavior, and refine your implementation based on the insghts gained.
