# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Muhammad Naquib Bin Zakaria
#### Matric No.: A20BE0161
#### Dataset: 03 - Movie

## Question 4

- The machine learning approach used in this project is `Content-Based Filtering`.
- `Content-Based Filtering` is a machine learning approach used in recommendation system that focuses on the characteristics and features of items (in this case, `movies`) to make recommendations.
- It analyzes the content or attributes of movies to identify similaritites and make personalized recommnedations to users.
- In this case, `movies.json` dataset will be used to create the movie recommendation system and will be focused on some attributes that available in the dataset which is `title`, `plot` and `genres`.
- So here are the steps on how to implement the machine learning approach:

1. Upload the dataset.
   - `Google Colab` will be used as platform to implement the machine learning process using python.
   - Then upload the dataset which is `movies.json` into `Google Colab Files`.

2. Import `pandas` library.
   - Pandas is a powerful open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently work with structured data, such as tables or spreadsheets, and perform various data operations.
   - ```
     import pandas as pd
     ```

3. Read the json file.
   - Read the `movies.json` that you have been uploaded into Google Colab file.
   - ```
     dataset_path = 'movies.json'
     data = pd.read_json(dataset_path, lines=True)
     ```

5. Data Cleaning.
   - Before start the machine learning
