# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Tan Yong Sheng
#### Matric No.: A20EC0157
#### Dataset: <a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/dataset/tree/main/mongodb/06-tweets">Tweets</a>

## Question 5 (a)
To optimize the performance of a portal when dealing with large volumes of data from a dataset, especially during dashboard visualizations, we can implement several strategies. Below are illustrative solution with code snippets and screenshots:

#
### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing can be done to reduce the database size by assigning correct data type and selecting the required column to import to database. This can ultimately reduce the dataset size and provide better performance of a portal.<br>
1. The first step is to load the dataset into Google Collab to perform data preprocessing.
```
import json
import pandas as pd


with open('modified_tweets.json', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    
print(data[1])
```

Output:
