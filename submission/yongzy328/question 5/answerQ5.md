# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Yong Zhi Yan
#### Matric No.: A20EC0172
#### Datatset: City Inspections	

## Question 5 (a)
To optimize the dataset, I choose to remove the unwanted or unrelated columns form the dataset to make it lighter and improve efficiency of the system. I had used Jupyter to code the optimization process.

#### 1. Import dataset
The dataset which stored in MongoDB under the database "AA" and collection "city" is loaded into a Python dataframe for further processes. <br>

#### 2. Pre-process the dataset
Since all the columns are of data type "Object", I have changed the data type of the column "date" into datetime format, so that it will be easier for further analysis work. I also noticed that the "id" of each inspection record is quite lengthy but share common alphabetical identification such as "ENFO", "CMPL", "UNIT" and etc. Thus, I decided to split the "id" by the "-" within it and keep only the meaningful alphabetical path. <br>

#### 3. Drop unrelated or unwanted columns
The columns "_id", "id1", "id2", "address.number", "address.zip", "address.street", "certificate_number" do not play any significant role in data analysis and visualization, thus I decided to drop all of them in order to minimize the dataset's volume. <br>

#### 4. Export to CSV
The dataframe is exported to CSV file for the further analysis or visualization purposes. <br>

## Question 5 (b)
I have utilized Microsoft Power BI to create the dashboard for city_inspection dataset. First, open Microsoft Power BI and import the JSON file which contain the cleaned data into the Power BI. I have changed the format of column "date" form text to date, and for other columns, the format are remained as text. 

The first chart I plot is a line chart which shows the number of inspections against the months. The configurations are shown as below.<br>

The second chart I plot is a bar chart which shows the top 10 sectors with most inspections. The configurations are shown as below.<br>

The third chart I plot is a horizontal stacked bar chart which shows the number of inspections against the sector along with the 5 most common results applicable. The configurations are shown as below.<br>

The completed dashboard is shown as below. <br>
