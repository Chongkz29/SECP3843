## Question 5 (b)
I have utilized Microsoft Power BI to create the dashboard for city_inspection dataset. First, open Microsoft Power BI and import the JSON file which contain the cleaned data into the Power BI. I have changed the format of column "date" form text to date, and for other columns, the format are remained as text. 

The first chart I plot is a line chart which shows the number of inspections against the months. The configurations are shown as below.<br>
