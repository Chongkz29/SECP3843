# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Yong Zhi Yan
#### Matric No.: A20EC0172
#### Dataset: City Inspections	

## Question 4
In this task, I implement the machine learning using the dataset, city_inspections.json through Jupyter. First, install the pymongo package to connect the MongoDB database with Jupyter using the code <code>pip install pymongo</code>.<br>

#### 1. Import data from MongoDB
Import the dataset that stored in the database "AA", collection "city" from the MongoDB and store in a dataframe. <br>

#### 2. Data preprocessing
View the database statistics by running the code <code>df.describe()</code><br>

View the dataframe information using the code <code>df.info()</code><br>

Since I am focusing on performing a classification prediction towards the business name on its sector, hence I will process the column "business_name" and "sector".
Replace all empty row of the column "business_name" with nan value, and then remove all null rows from the column "business_name". <br>

Replace all empty row of the column "sector" with nan value, and then remove all null rows from the column "sector". <br>
<img src="./files/images/Screenshot%202023-06-29%20130226.png" alt="sector null"><br>
View the summary of each sector counts. <br>
<img src="./files/images/Screenshot%202023-06-29%20141951.png" alt="sector count"><br>
Since there is a lot of sector with counts less than 1000, hence I will be removing them as they would not be involved in the classification model. <br>

#### 3. Classification using Decision Tree Classifier
I have applied a few classfication algorithms including the SVM model, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classifier. All the algorithm mentioned do not give a high accuracy (60% - 70%), except that the Decision Tree Classifier shows the highest accuracy as 82.53%, hence it is accepted as the machine learning model for this dataset. <br>
<img src="./files/images/Screenshot%202023-06-29%20142035.png" alt="ml1"><br>
The model is also been tested with newly user input data, and show accurate results in prediction. <br>
