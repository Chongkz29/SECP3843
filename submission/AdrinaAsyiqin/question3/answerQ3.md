# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Adrina Asyiqin Binti Md Adha
#### Matric No.: A20EC0174
#### Dataset: sales.json

## Question 3 (a)

 
## Question 3 (b)
### Step 1: Database selection
Choose appropriate database replication method or tool that supports both MySQL and MongoDB databases. This could involve exploring options like native replication mechanisms provided by the database themselves or utilising third-party tools specifically designed for database synchronization

### Step 2: Configuration Setup
Configure the replication settings for both databases to establish the necessary connections and define the replicaiton behaviour. This typically involves configuring replication parameters such as replication source (MySQL) and replication target (MongoDB) settings.

### Step 3: Replication initialization
Initialise the replication process by ensuring that the target database (mongoDB) is empty or contains data consistent with the source database (MySQL). This step may require performing an initial data load from MySQL and MongoDB

### Step 4: Replication Monitoring
Set up monitoring mechanisms to track the replication process and ensure its smooth operation. This can involve monitoring tools or scripts that provide real-time status updates and alert in case of any issues or inconsistencies.

### Step 4: Testing and Verification
Thoroughly test and verify the replication setup to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Perform tests that simulate various scenarios and edge cases to validate the replication behavior.
