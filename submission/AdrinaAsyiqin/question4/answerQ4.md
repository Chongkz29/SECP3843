# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Adrina Asyiqin Binti Md Adha
#### Matric No.: A20EC0174
#### Dataset: sales.json

## Question 4 
### Macbine Learning Approach
#### Decision Tree
- Data preparation
  - Software that will be used is Alteryx
  - Preprocess the sales data. Ensure the data is in a structured format with relevant features and a target variable (e.g., sales amount, customer category).
  - Split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to build the decision tree model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
- Feature selection
  - Identify the features from the sales data that are most relevant to predicting the target variable. This can involve analyzing the correlation between features and the target, performing statistical tests, or using domain knowledge.
  - Select the subset of features that will be used to build the decision tree model.


#### Time Series Analysis
Step 1: Data preparation
Step 2: Data Exploration
Step 3: Time Series Decomposition
Step 4: Stationary Testing
Step 5: Model Selection
Step 6: Model Fitting and Parameter Estimation
Step 7: Model Validation
Step 8: Forecasting
