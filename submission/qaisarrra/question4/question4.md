# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Qaisara binti Rohzan
#### Matric No.: A20EC0133
#### Dataset: 04 - Companies

## Question 4 
Machine learning is a branch of computer science that enables computers to learn without having to be explicitly programmed. Machine learning is classified into two types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In this question, we will be performing appropriate machine learning approach or algorithm by using Python. I will be including snippets of my Python code from my Google Colab project file here.

**Installing Libraries**

```bash
!pip install pymongo
```

```bash
 import pymongo
 import pandas as pd
 import numpy as np
```
<br></br>

**Connect Database**

```bash
# Create the client
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb+srv://qaisara:qaisara8@companies.m3iqyfp.mongodb.net")

# Connect to our database
db = client["AA"]

# Fetch our series collection
collection = db["Companies"]

data = list(collection.find())
```
<br></br>

**Convert extracted data to DataFrame**
```bash
companies = pd.DataFrame(data)
companies
```
