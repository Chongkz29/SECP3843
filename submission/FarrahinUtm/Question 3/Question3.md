# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: NURFARRAHIN BINTI CHE ALIAS
#### Matric No.: A20EC0121
#### Dataset: Mflix

## Question 3 (a)
On this project, the module for managing user registration and login will be placed in the mySQL database. This system is used by three types of people: customers, technical workers, and senior management. Describe in detail the creation of this module on the web server (Django) and the database (mySQL).
## Question 2 (b)
When working with two different databases, the challenge of Data Replication and Synchronization arises between the MySQL and MongoDB databases. This challenge involves ensuring that any changes made in one database are accurately reflected in the other, thereby
 
maintaining data consistency across both systems. To overcome this issue, it is recommended to explore database-specific replication techniques or leverage external tools that facilitate real- time updates and seamless interaction between the databases. In your response, provide a detailed description of the steps involved in addressing this challenge. You may include relevant code snippets and screenshots that illustrate the solution implemented.
