# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Maizatul Afrina Safiah Binti Saiful Azwan
#### Matric No.: A20EC0204
#### Dataset: City Inspections

## Question 5 (a)


## Question 5 (b)

To create a dashboard using JSON dataset, there are several platforms that can be used which are Power BI, Tableau as well as MongoDB Atlas Charts. However, it was found out that MongoDB Atlas Charts is best option for this task compared to Power BI and Tableau. One of the main reasons is Seamless Integration with MongoDB since it allows direct connection from the dataset. This can make the loading and transform process become smoother.
