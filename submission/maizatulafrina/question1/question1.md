# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Maizatul Afrina Safiah Binti Saiful Azwan
#### Matric No.: A20EC0204
#### Dataset: City Inspections

## Question 1 (a)

To ensure seamless integration between the Django web framework, a JSON dataset provided in this
project, and the MySQL and MongoDB databases, few servers need to be setup and configure.

**1. Django**
   - Open Command Prompt and run `pip install Django` command.

   - Then, run `django-admin startproject inspection` command to create Django project.

   - Next step, in order to create a django app inside the folder, run `python manage.py startapp inspectionApp`. This is where we can define all the models for MySQL and MongoDB.

   - The other packages that need to be installed are mysqlclient and djongo. To install mysqlclient, run `pip install django mysqlclient pymongo` command.

   - For djongo, run `pip install djongo` command.

**2. Define Connection Details for MySQL and MongoDB**
   -  In `settings.py` file, define the connection details for both MySQL and MongoDB database which include database name, username, password, host and others.

**3. Define models for Django**

-  In `models.py` file, define the models according to its data structure and data types.

      ```python
      from django.db import models
      
      class Inspection(models.Model):
          id = models.CharField(max_length=50, primary_key=True)
          certificate_number = models.IntegerField()
          business_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          date = models.DateField()
          result = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          sector = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          city = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          zip_code = models.IntegerField()
          street = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          number = models.IntegerField()
      
          def __str__(self):
              return self.name

**4. Migrate the Models**

- To do migration, run `python manage.py makemigrations` command and `python manage.py migrate` command.

**5. Retrieve Data**

   - Web Server (Django Framework): The web server component is responsible for handling client requests, managing URL routing, and rendering dynamic web pages. In this architecture, Django, a Python-based web framework, is used as the web server. Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a high-level abstraction for building web applications. It facilitates the seamless integration of the other components and ensures efficient communication between the client and the backend.

   - JSON Dataset: The JSON dataset component contains the data that needs to be imported into the databases. It follows a specific structure that matches the expected format for the target databases. The JSON dataset can be stored in a file or retrieved from an external source. It acts as the source of data for populating the databases and provides the initial set of information for the application.

   - MySQL Database: The MySQL database component is a popular relational database management system. It provides a structured storage solution with support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. In this architecture, MySQL is integrated with Django using the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). It allows seamless interaction with the MySQL database, including querying, data retrieval, and manipulation.

   - MongoDB Database: The MongoDB database component is a NoSQL document-oriented database. It offers a flexible schema and scalability, making it suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. In this architecture, Django integrates with MongoDB using the mongoengine library, which provides an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) layer. This allows the application to interact with MongoDB, perform queries, retrieve data, and manipulate documents.
