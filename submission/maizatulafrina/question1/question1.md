# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Maizatul Afrina Safiah Binti Saiful Azwan
#### Matric No.: A20EC0204
#### Dataset: City Inspections

## Question 1 (a)

To ensure seamless integration between the Django web framework, a JSON dataset provided in this
project, and the MySQL and MongoDB databases, few servers need to be setup and configure.

**1. Django**
   - Open Command Prompt and run `pip install Django` command.

   - Then, run `django-admin startproject inspection` command to create Django project.

   - Next step, in order to create a django app inside the folder, run `python manage.py startapp inspectionApp`. This is where we can define all the models for MySQL and MongoDB.

   - The other packages that need to be installed are mysqlclient and djongo. To install mysqlclient, run `pip install django mysqlclient pymongo` command.

   - For djongo, run `pip install djongo` command.

**2. Define Connection Details for MySQL and MongoDB**
   -  In `settings.py` file, define the connection details for both MySQL and MongoDB database which include database name, username, password, host and others.

**3. Define models for Django**

-  In `models.py` file, define the models according to its data structure and data types.

      ```python
      from django.db import models
      
      class Inspection(models.Model):
          id = models.CharField(max_length=50, primary_key=True)
          certificate_number = models.IntegerField()
          business_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          date = models.DateField()
          result = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          sector = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          city = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          zip_code = models.IntegerField()
          street = models.CharField(max_length=255)
          number = models.IntegerField()
      
          class Meta:
           app_label = 'inspectionApp'
           db_table = 'tb_inspection'

**4. Migrate the Models**

- To do migration, run `python manage.py makemigrations` command and `python manage.py migrate` command.

**5. Retrieve Data**

- Load the JSON Dataset into database

   - Web Server (Django Framework): The task of receiving client requests, controlling URL routing, and generating dynamic web pages falls under the purview of the web server component. The web server in this architecture is Django, a web framework built on Python. Django offers a high-level abstraction for creating web applications and adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural paradigm. It ensures effective communication between the client and the backend and enables the seamless integration of the other components.

   - JSON Dataset: The data that has to be imported into the databases is contained in the JSON dataset component. It adheres to a particular structure that corresponds to the desired format for the target databases. The JSON dataset can be downloaded from a remote source or kept in a file. It serves as the data source for filling databases and gives the application its initial collection of data.

   - MySQL Database: Popular relational database management systems include the MySQL database component. With support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) qualities, it offers a structured storage solution. Using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), MySQL is integrated with Django in this design. It enables smooth querying, data retrieval, and modification interactions with the MySQL database.

   - MongoDB Database: A NoSQL document-oriented database, MongoDB is one of the database components. Its scalability and flexible schema make it appropriate for managing unstructured or semi-structured data. The Object-Document Mapping (ODM) layer provided by the mongoengine module, which is used in this design, allows Django to integrate with MongoDB. This makes it possible for the application to communicate with MongoDB, run queries, get data, and work with documents.
