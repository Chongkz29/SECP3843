# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: ADAM WAFII BIN AZUAR

#### Matric No.: A20EC0003

#### Dataset: MFLIX DATASET

## Question 4

The approach I used is form of content-based filtering, which is a type of recommendation system. Content-based filtering recommends items (in this case, movies) to users based on the similarity of their attributes or content. In this case, I used the movie genres, cast, directors, and plot as the attributes to calculate the similarity between movies and generate recommendations.

Install the necessary libraries:

```
    pip install pymongo
    pip install pandas
```

1.  Retrieve the Mflix datatset from MongoDB
    The code will retrieve the movies data from MongoDB collection named `mflixx`, iterates over each movie and extracts the rating from `imdb` field. It stores all the ratings of the movie. I used the `json_normalize` function that will extract the "rating" attribute from the "imdb" field.

2.  Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing

         i. Remove the unnecessary clomuns by removing the columns that are not relevant for the recommendation system. Drop teh columns by using the `drop()` function and for "tomatoes" column I'm using the `startwith()` method.

         ii. Remove the rows that contains missing values by using the `dropna()` function.

         iii. Remove special characters, cleaning and preprocessing for column "Plot" and "Genre"

3.  Feature Extraction & Representation
    The approach I used is vectorized representation of the item features which will allow efficient computation and comparison of item similarities.

         i. Concatenate the text-based feature columns into a single column. I've used the `apply()` method along with `join()` and also `map(str,row) method.

4.  Calculate Similarity
To calculate the similarity between text documents, I've used method cosine similarity by importing TF-IDF vectors.

5.  Generate Recommendations
    To generate movie recommendations based on the similarity scores, I defined a function that takes a movie title as input and returns a list of recommended movies.
