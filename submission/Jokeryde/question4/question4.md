# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: ADAM WAFII BIN AZUAR

#### Matric No.: A20EC0003

#### Dataset: MFLIX DATASET

## Question 4

The approach I used is form of content-based filtering, which is a type of recommendation system. Content-based filtering recommends items (in this case, movies) to users based on the similarity of their attributes or content. In this case, I used the movie genres, cast, directors, and plot as the attributes to calculate the similarity between movies and generate recommendations.

Install the necessary libraries:
```
    pip install pymongo
    pip install pandas
```

  1. Retrieve the Mflix datatset from MongoDB
     The code will retrieve the movies data from MongoDB collection named `mflixx`, iterates over each movie and extracts the rating from `imdb` field. It stores all the ratings of the movie. I used the `json_normalize` function that will extract the "rating" attribute from the "imdb" field.







   

     2. Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing

         i. Remove the unnecessary clomuns by removing the columns that are not relevant for the recommendation system. Drop teh columns by using the `dropna()` function.
