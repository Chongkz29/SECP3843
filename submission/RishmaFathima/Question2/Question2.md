# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Rishma Fathima Binti Basher
#### Matric No.: A20EC0137
#### Dataset: [Airbnb Listings Dataset](https://github.com/drshahizan/dataset/tree/c8e9f4a7cbdb0c1b78ca2c73915ff56ceeb50e70/mongodb/05-airbnb)

## Question 2 (a)
1. Opened the dataset which was assigned to me in Github which was entitled ‚ÄòAirbnb Listing Dataset‚Äô
2. Download the raw file and save it as ‚ÄòlistingAndReviews.json‚Äô from the Github before working on it.
3. The file is opened through visual studio code to see if the data is available and ready to be used in MongoDB
4. I navigated to MongoDB Compass on my device and opened it. I had to connect to deployment containing the collections I wish to import my dataset into. I left the connection string (URI) as default as ‚Äúmongodb://localhost:2017‚Äù and connect to it.
5. After the connection is successful, I could view the MongoDB Compass User interface as below. Then, I clicked on the small ‚Äò+‚Äô icon on database to add a database.
6. Then, I created a new database with the database name as ‚ÄòAA‚Äô and Collection Name as ‚ÄòAirbnb‚Äô.
7. After the database is successfully created, I could see the collection and database created.
8. Then, I could view the collection created with its details in MongoDB Compass.
9. Then, to import the data, I clicked on the ‚ÄòImport Data‚Äô icon and it redirect to my file explorer for me to select the file which I wish to import. Then I selected the file which I downloaded from Github named ‚ÄòlistingAndReviews.json‚Äô
10. After the file is successfully imported, I could view a small notification at the bottom left indicating that the import is completed with 5555 documents imported.
11. The output of imported document is shown below:
