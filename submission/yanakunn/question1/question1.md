# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: NURARISSA DAYANA BINTI MOHD SUKRI
#### Matric No.: A20EC0120
#### Dataset: SALES

## Question 1 (a)
Integrating the Django framework, JSON data, MySQL, and MongoDB can be achieved without explicitly using five servers. One way to do this is by running Django on a web server and using separate servers for MySQL and MongoDB databases. This method simplifies the integration and makes the system more efficient.

However, configuring five servers can improve performance and increase scalability. The five servers will serve the following functions:

1. Web Server: A web server such as Apache will host your Django application, handle HTTP requests, and create dynamic web pages.
2. MySQL Server: MySQL RDBMS that can handle structured data storage.
3. MongoDB Server: NoSQL database that can store and retrieves data using JSON-like documents.
4. Load Balancer Server: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers.
5. Backup Server: Store backups of the application's data securely.

Considering the sales dataset size, we may only require some of the five servers when setting up a production environment. A load balancer server may not be necessary since we do not anticipate a lot of traffic.

### Steps required to integrate Django with the JSON dataset, MySQL, and MongoDB:

Step 1: Install Django and Required Packages
