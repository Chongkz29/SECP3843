# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Dataset: SALES

## Question 1 (a)
Integrating the Django framework, JSON data, MySQL, and MongoDB can be achieved without explicitly using five servers. One way to do this is by running Django on a web server and using separate servers for MySQL and MongoDB databases. This method simplifies the integration and makes the system more efficient.

However, configuring five servers can improve performance and increase scalability. The web server handles user requests, while two database servers store the data. A load balancer will distribute traffic between the web server and the database servers, and a backup server will store data backups. The five servers will serve the following functions:

1. Web Server: A web server such as Apache will host your Django application and handle incoming HTTP requests. The server will work with the Django framework to process the requests and create dynamic web pages.
2. MySQL Server: MySQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS) that can handle structured data storage. It is commonly used with Django to store user data.
3. MongoDB Server: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. The MongoDB server stores and retrieves data using JSON-like documents.
4. Load Balancer Server: A load balancers server, such as HAProxy or Nginx, distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers.
5. Backup Server: A backup server, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, allows you to store backups of your application's data securely.

When establishing a production environment, the five servers described can serve as a valuable initial guide. However, it is crucial to consider your individual requirements, as not all of them may be necessary. For example, a load balancer or cache server may not be required if you do not expect high traffic volumes. Tailoring your server setup to your specific needs is imperative to optimize efficiency and functionality.

Here's a more accurate explanation of the steps required to integrate Django with the JSON dataset, MySQL, and MongoDB:

Step 1: Install Django and Required Packages
