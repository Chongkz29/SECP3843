# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: NURARISSA DAYANA BINTI MOHD SUKRI
#### Matric No.: A20EC0120
#### Dataset: SALES

## Question 5 (a)
When dealing with large volumes of JSON data in a portal and aiming to optimize performance during dashboard visualizations, there are several strategies to employ:

1. Data Aggregation

Rather than processing the complete dataset for each visualization, pre-calculate and save the aggregated values for the dashboard.

3. Pagination and Lazy Loading

To enhance the performance of the Django application, we can implement pagination or lazy loading. The application will load and display a smaller amount of data first, reducing the load time and improving the responsiveness.

5. Client-Side Data Processing

Libraries like Chart.js can help with data manipulations and visualizations, which reduces the amount of data transferred between the server and the client.
