# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Nayli Nabihah Binti Jasni
#### Matric No.: A20EC0105
#### Dataset: Companies

## Question 3 (a)
#### Step 1: Define Django Model (For User)

Since in this part focuses in the authentication of users in Django project, a user model should be define in Django. In Django, there is a built-in framework specifically for authentication. By using this built-in framework, it helps to ease the processes of making models and some functionalities for user authentication management as it has already pre-built. The framework used in `django.contrib.auth.models'. Below is the code that shoul be written in models.py

![model]()
 
#### Step 2: Create Registration Form for Users

This can be done by using the Django forms.  Since I had already used the built-in framework for authentication of users, the form will collect the information from the users such as username, email and password by default. As the form is submitted, Django will firstly validate the submitted data then, create a new user based on the user type that has been declared in models.py. Note that, all of these users information will be stored into MySQL database.

- Create forms.py under the folder 'app' in the Django project.

- Update the views.py as we wanted to add the registration view.

- Create a folder named as 'template' under folder 'app' to grouped all the html files that being used in this Django project. Then create a html file for registration template.
