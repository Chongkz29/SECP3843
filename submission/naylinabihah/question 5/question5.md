# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Nayli Nabihah Binti Jasni
#### Matric No.: A20EC0105
#### Dataset: Companies

## Question 5 (a)
There are many ways to ensure an optimized performance of a website/portal when working with large volume of data in a JSON file. Either using pagination, indexing, caching, data ingestion and storage and many more.

The focused technique used in this answer is by using the data ingestion and storage. The storage used is stored in MongoDB and MySQL.
These are the steps that should be considered:

1. Import the needed libraries, then create a connection to the Databases.

2. Store the JSON file in MongoDB.

3. Take the data from MongoDB to do the dashboard visualization.

4. In MySQL, all transformed data from the MongoDB will be collected and stored there to ensure    better efficency of data retrieval and querying.

## Question 5 (b)

#### 1. Login to MongoDB Atlas and Connect to MongoDB Compass
Do this by click connect on the collection card. Then, click on 'Charts' to start creating charts in dashboard.

#### 2. Load Dataset
Choose the desired dataset from the collection saved earlier on

#### 3. Create Desired Chart and Design the Dashboard

There are 7 charts that consists of 3 bar charts, 2 Geo Choropleth chart, 2 cards.

These are the charts created in the dashboard:

![c1](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/naylinabihah/question%205/files/images/c1.png)

This chart is built based on the company and their number of employees. I only take top 50 on the list to insert in this chart


![c2](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/naylinabihah/question%205/files/images/c2.png)

This is a geo choropleth chart that describes the number of employees in each country

![c3](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/naylinabihah/question%205/files/images/c3.png)

This is also a geo choropleth chart that describes the sum of acquisition price amount of companies in each country

![c4](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/naylinabihah/question%205/files/images/c4.png)

These are the cards that used to show the highest acquisition amount made by a company and the highes raised amount by a company

![c5](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/naylinabihah/question%205/files/images/c5.png)

This chart is built to see the top 20 categories of company founded

![c6](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/naylinabihah/question%205/files/images/c6.png)

This chart shows the number of company founded in each decade

![c7](https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/blob/main/submission/naylinabihah/question%205/files/images/NNJ_dbd.png)

This is the full dashboard view I had done.


#### Additional Charts
I also had made some additional charts using python in google colab. To view it, click [here]().
