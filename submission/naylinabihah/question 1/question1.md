# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Nayli Nabihah Binti Jasni
#### Matric No.: A20EC0105
#### Dataset: Companies

## Question 1 (a)
This portal is going to implement the usage of Django, JSON, MySQL and MongoDB. To built the best portal in terms of seamless integration between these four things in five servers at most, there are many ways to do so. These are the ways that I choose to use as an IT consultant in this case.

First, since using Django web framework, we should install Django framework in all 5 servers to ensure that everything is uniformed and can work properly. 'pip' can be used to install Django project in the servers as it act as a package installer for Python specifically. All servers should have the same version of Django and make sure that the version is stable and compatible with the devices and operating system.

```python
!pip install django
```

```python
!django-admin startproject portal
```
