# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Nayli Nabihah Binti Jasni
#### Matric No.: A20EC0105
#### Dataset: Companies

## Question 1 (a)
This portal is going to implement the usage of Django, JSON, MySQL and MongoDB. To built the best portal in terms of seamless integration between these four things in five servers at most, there are many ways to do so. These are the ways that I choose to use as an IT consultant in this case.

First, since using Django web framework, we should install Django framework in all 5 servers to ensure that everything is uniformed and can work properly. 'pip' can be used to install Django project in the servers as it act as a package installer for Python specifically. All servers should have the same version of Django and make sure that the version is stable and compatible with the devices and operating system. The five servers are Web Server/Hosting for the portal after publishing it live, application server is used when doing the project locally, two database server, one for each MySQL and MongoDB.....

After installing it, build a Django project in one of five the servers that we had using the terminal (command prompt). Build the project in application server as it will act as a main server for this project

```python
!pip install django
```

```python
!django-admin startproject portal
```

After installing Django and building Django project in the application server, the settings of the Django project should be configured as it is where the database configurations is placed. When creating a Django Project, there is a file named as 'settings.py' where stores all the information on the database, in this case both databases that we used which are MySQL and MongoDB. In this file, the configurations of the databases including the database engine, database name, username, host, password and port. The configuration of MySQL and MongoDB might not be in the same exact look but they are similar too each other.
