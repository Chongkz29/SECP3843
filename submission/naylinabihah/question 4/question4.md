# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: Nayli Nabihah Binti Jasni
#### Matric No.: A20EC0105
#### Dataset: Companies

## Question 4

There are many ways and algorithms that can be chosen when it comes to machine learning. Either choose from unsupervised learning or supervised learning algorithms, all the algorithms has its own purposes and uses that are versatile for various range of datasets. 

The dataset given is about the information of companies that were retrieved from Cruchbase, a company that provides businees information about companies either public or private. This dataset contains 42 columns which most of it is in array form which can be challenging when doing the machine learning. I had chosen to use the `Regression Analysis` that focuses on the total money raised by the companies against the number of competitions they had. `Regression Analysis` is a common supervised learning implemented to find the realationship between two variables that  one act as target variable (dependant) and the other one as predictor variable (independant). Below are the steps I implemented when doing the `Regression Analysis`.

#### Step 1: Import the JSON File into Google Colab
Since earlier on I had already insert the JSON file in MongoDB, now I can retrieve the JSON file using python through a library called `pymongo`.
