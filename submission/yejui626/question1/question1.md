# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: GOO YE JUI
#### Matric No.: A20EC0191
#### Dataset: Stories Dataset

## Question 1 (a)
### Explanation of steps required to integrate Django with JSON, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval from both MySQL and MongoDB databases.
These are the steps for implementing a configuration using the servers used in this project. It is to ensure seamless integration between the Django web framework, a JSON dataset provided in this project, and the MySQL and MongoDB databases.

### 1. Steps to setup Django server including the project and application folder.
First, we are using the Django web framework as the base for building the portal. Hence, we need to setup the Django server.

1. Locate to the project file and create a virtual environment.
```python
py -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

2. Once you‚Äôve created and activated your Python virtual environment, you can install Django into this dedicated development workspace using `pip install django`. <br>

3. After you‚Äôve successfully installed Django, you‚Äôre ready to create the scaffolding for your new web application. With your virtual environment set up and activated and Django installed, you can now create a project using `django-admin startproject AA_Goo`

4. For this project, we need to create an app contain the functionality of providing users with a platform for viewing data and executing dashboard visualizations based on JSON-provided data. You can execute the startapp command through the manage.py file using `py manage.py startapp stories` to generates a default folder structure for a Django app.

### 2. Configuring Django database settings
   1. Open the Django project's `settings.py` file.
   2. Define the database settings for both MySQL and MongoDB.
   ``` python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
                'NAME': 'aa',
                'USER': 'root',
                'PASSWORD': '',
                'HOST': 'localhost',
                'PORT': 8000,
            },
            'mongodb': {
                'ENGINE': 'djongo',
                'ENFORCE_SCHEMA': False,
                'NAME': 'AA',
                'CLIENT': {
                    'host': 'localhost:27017',
                    'port': 27017,
                    'username': '',
                    'password': '',
                }
            }
        }
   ```
   3. Install database connectors ("mysqlclient" and "djongo" library) for MySQL and MongoDB using 
   ``` python
    pip install mysqlclient
    pip install djongo
   ```   
### 2. Configuring Django models
To allow seamless integration between Django and the databases, we need to define a Django models that represent the structure and fields of the JSON dataset.

   1. Open the stories app's `models.py` file.
   2. Define Django models that represent the structure and fields of the JSON dataset according to the data dictionary.
   ``` python
        from django.db import models


        class Container(models.Model):
            _DATABASE = "mongodb"
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            short_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)


        class Topic(models.Model):
            _DATABASE = "mongodb"
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            short_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)


        class User(models.Model):
            _DATABASE = "mongodb"
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            registered = models.DateTimeField()
            fullname = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            icon = models.URLField()
            profileviews = models.IntegerField()


        class ShortURL(models.Model):
            _DATABASE = "mongodb"
            short_url = models.URLField()
            view_count = models.IntegerField()


        class Story(models.Model):
            _DATABASE = "mongodb"
            _id = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
            href = models.URLField()
            title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            comments = models.IntegerField()
            container = models.ForeignKey(Container, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
            submit_date = models.DateTimeField()
            topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
            promote_date = models.DateTimeField()
            id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            media = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            diggs = models.IntegerField()
            description = models.TextField()
            link = models.URLField()
            user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
            status = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            shorturl = models.ManyToManyField(ShortURL)
   ```
### 3. Configuring Django Database Routing
To allow Django to support multiple databases, we require a database routing to specify which database to use for each model. Routing rules to route specific models to MySQL or MongoDB based on their requirements is set up under this file. For example, the models `[Container, Topic, User, ShortURL, Story]` that we have just created is routed to MongoDB.

```python
class DatabaseRouter:
    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        return getattr(model, "_DATABASE", "default")

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        return getattr(model, "_DATABASE", "default")

    def allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):
        """
        Relations between objects are allowed if both objects are
        in the master/slave pool.
        """
        db_list = ('default')
        return obj1._state.db in db_list and obj2._state.db in db_list

    def allow_migrate(self, db, model):
        """
        All non-auth models end up in this pool.
        """
        return True  
```


## Question 1 (b)
### System Architecture Diagram
This system architecture focuses on the seamless integration between the web server (Django), dataset (JSON), and databases (MySQL and MongoDB). <br>
![Alt text](./files/images/System%20Architecture.png)

### Detailed explanation for each component

   - **Django Web Server and MVT** <br>
   Django acts as an agent to process the requests from the users and send response to the users while interacting with the databases and dataset.
      - **Models:** Specify the necessary data structures and relationships required by the application which allow us to do CRUD seamlessly.
      - **Views:** Handle the logic for processing requests, retrieving data from the databases, and rendering templates.
      - **Templates:** Contain the HTML structure and placeholders for dynamic data.

   - **Dataset (JSON)** <br>
   Location of the dataset is stored. In this case, the dataset was downloaded to local from github.

   - **Databases** <br>
      Handles data storage, retrieval, and management operations.
      - **MySQL:**
      It is a relational database server which used to store structure data. In this project, it is used to store user authentication data used for user registration and login.
      - **MongoDB:**
      It is a NoSQL database server which used to store JSON data. In this project, it is used to store the JSON dataset (Stories dataset).

   - **External Libraries for database integration**
        - **ORM**: 
         To perform interaction between Django models and MySQL, Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) provides an abstraction layer that allows us to work with MySQL using Python classes and methods, making it easier to perform database operations.
        - **Djongo**: 
        Django can serve as the MongoDB connector when integrating it with MongoDB. Djongo enables interaction between Django models and MongoDB collections.
